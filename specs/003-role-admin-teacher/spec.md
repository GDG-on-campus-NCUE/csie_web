# Feature Specification: Role-Based Management System Restructuring

**Feature Branch**: `003-role-admin-teacher`  
**Created**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "後台有三種role
1. admin (所有管理頁面)
2. teacher (公告管理、研究管理、教師teacher與user一對一連動，只能罐裡自己的)
3. user
原先有admin，但現在統一搬到manage裡面
4. 盡量讓component重複使用
5. 畫面整體需要白底、乾淨
6. bug修正
7. 使整體程式碼使用組件(更好維護)(是指重複度高的)
8. RWD
9. setting畫面"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ✓
   → Identified role-based management system with three user types
2. Extract key concepts from description ✓
   → Identified: role permissions, UI restructuring, component reuse, responsive design
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific permissions does 'user' role have?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes the 'setting畫面' requirements?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the current bugs that need fixing?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ✓
5. Generate Functional Requirements ✓
6. Identify Key Entities ✓
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarifications needed
8. Return: PARTIAL SUCCESS (spec needs clarification)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system user with different roles (admin, teacher, user), I need a role-based management interface that provides appropriate access controls and permissions so that I can efficiently manage my authorized areas while maintaining system security and data integrity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an admin user, **When** I log in to the management system, **Then** I should have access to all management pages including user management, content management, research management, and system settings
2. **Given** I am a teacher user, **When** I log in to the management system, **Then** I should have access only to announcement management and research management for my own content
3. **Given** I am a teacher user, **When** I attempt to access another teacher's content, **Then** the system should deny access and show appropriate permissions message
4. **Given** I am a user with basic role, **When** I log in, **Then** I should have access to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific user role permissions not defined]
5. **Given** any authorized user, **When** I access the management interface on mobile devices, **Then** the interface should be fully responsive and functional
6. **Given** any authorized user, **When** I access settings, **Then** I should see a clean, white-background interface with appropriate settings options

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a teacher user is deactivated but still has content in the system?
- How does the system handle role changes for existing users?
- What happens when a user's teacher profile is disconnected from their user account?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide three distinct user roles: admin, teacher, and user with differentiated access permissions
- **FR-002**: System MUST grant admin users access to all management pages and system functions
- **FR-003**: System MUST grant teacher users access only to announcement management and research management for their own content
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce one-to-one relationship between teacher role and user account
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent teacher users from accessing or modifying content belonging to other teachers
- **FR-006**: System MUST consolidate all admin functions under a unified management interface structure
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide reusable UI components to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement a clean, white-background design theme across all management interfaces
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide fully responsive design (RWD) for all management interfaces
- **FR-010**: System MUST include a settings interface for user configuration and preferences
- **FR-011**: System MUST resolve existing bugs in the current management system [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific bugs not identified]
- **FR-012**: Users with 'user' role MUST have access to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user role permissions not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents system users with role assignment (admin, teacher, user), linked to authentication and permission system
- **Teacher Profile**: Represents teacher-specific information and content, maintains one-to-one relationship with User entity
- **Role**: Defines permission sets and access levels for different user types
- **Management Interface**: Consolidated interface structure housing all administrative functions
- **Reusable Components**: Standardized UI elements for consistent user experience and code maintainability
- **Settings Profile**: User-specific configuration and preference data
